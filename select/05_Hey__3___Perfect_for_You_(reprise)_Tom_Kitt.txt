Hey

Hey

you look like a star.
a vision in blue

Oh I do?

and you are.
Hey, you came.

well I said that I might

I thought we were through
me and you.

Not tonight.

will your mom be okay?

well she might be someday.

But for now it's all fine

she's still on my mind

can you leave it behind? stay.
let's see this thing through.

am I crazy?
I might end up crazy.

I'll be here for you

you say that right here
but then give it a year
or ten years
or a life
I could end up your wife
sitting staring at walls
throwing shit down the stairs
freaking out at the store
running nude down the street
bleeding out in the bath...

Perfect for you.
I will be perfect for you.
so you could go crazy
or I could go crazy
it's true.
sometimes life is insane
but crazy I know I can do
cause crazy is perfect
and fucked up is perfect
so I will be perfect

perfect...

perfect for...

you...
